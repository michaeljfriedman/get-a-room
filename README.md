# get-a-room
Princeton University study space finder

## What is it, and how does it work?
Our app helps students find available study spaces on campus. We present them with a map of the campus where each building is color-coded red/yellow/green to indicate how busy the study spaces are there. They can click on any building to see real-time information about how many people are using each study space, so students can find a place that isn't too busy.

We obtain these real-time occupancy statistics by determining the number of devices connected to wireless access points (APs) on campus, and using that as an indication of how many people are in the room. This data (will eventually be) obtained from OIT.
